# Module3-Form

## Contact form

Welcome to my Module3 Form assignment. I made a simple contact form with the inputs, name, email, age and message. All of the fields are required and also have custom validation elements. 

## Usage

+ Clone this project and open up the [index.html](index.html) to view the page. 
+ All styles are in [styles.css](styles.css).
+ All Javascript is in [script.js](script.js) with comments.
+ There is also a result page [result.html](results.html) witch has its own javascript file that you find here: [results.js](results.js)
